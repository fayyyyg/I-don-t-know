### Artist Statment

Yifei Gao's works predominantly consist of 2D images created with mixed materials,
including oil on canvas and watercolor. For me, color is a decisive factor in determining the
appeal of a piece. It goes beyond mere aesthetics; color serves as a powerful means of
expression, deeply influenced by cultural context. I am fascinated by how color can evoke
emotions, how a simple shade or hue can stir profound responses that are shaped by individual
and collective experiences.

However, beyond the beauty, there is a persistent sense of emptiness. My work often
reflects a tension between the visual allure and the void that lies beneath. While I use color and
texture to convey emotion, I am equally draw to the question: what remains after the beauty
fades? This curiosity leads me to explore nihilism in my art-the idea that everything is
transient and fleeting. The vibrant colors, while captivating, are ultimately a surface, masking
emotions that may dissolve into nothingness. In my work, I strive to balance the attraction of
visual beauty with the acknowledgment of its inherent fragility. Beauty can be compelling, but
it can also be empty. This paradox is what drives me to create and what I find most compelling
to express through my art.
