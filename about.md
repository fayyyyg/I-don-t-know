### Bio

Yifei Gao is a highly accomplished painter and mixed media artist, having grown up in Hunan Changsha, China before relocating to California. Currently, she is enrolled in the Bachelor of Fine Arts program at the prestigious School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) and has been granted the Merit Scholarship. Her artistic journey has led her to exhibit in esteemed galleries such as Artbash, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, 202G and Valley Gallery, Chicago, 202G. Gao's unique approach combines an emphasis on the technical aspects of art-making with a sense of emotional detachment, reflecting her deep fascination with the artificial and unnatural.

### Artist Statement

Yifei Gao's body of work predominantly features 2D images created using mixed materials, including oil on canvas and watercolor. Color plays a crucial role in her art, serving not only as an aesthetic element but also as a powerful means of expression deeply influenced by cultural context. She is captivated by how color can evoke emotions, and how a simple shade or hue can stir profound responses shaped by individual and collective experiences.

However, beyond the beauty, there is a persistent sense of emptiness that permeates her work. This tension between visual allure and the void beneath reflects a curiosity about nihilism â€“ the idea that everything is transient and fleeting. The vibrant colors, while captivating, are ultimately a surface, concealing emotions that may dissolve into nothingness. In her art, Gao strives to harmonize the allure of visual beauty with an acknowledgment of its inherent fragility. Beauty can be compelling, but it can also be empty. This paradox is what drives her creative process and forms the core of her artistic expression.
